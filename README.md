# Treasure, Inc
A simple app to play test Treasure, Inc., a board game I am making. The future promises of a app that allows for the creation of different games that exist within the same design space. Also, logging of play session events and, if the design space can be formalized adequately, the ability to export the game into formal game-checking tools that enable a designer to ask questions like "can a player achieve X state?"
